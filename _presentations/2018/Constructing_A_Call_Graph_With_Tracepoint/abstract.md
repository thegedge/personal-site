# Title
Tracepoint: Examining the execution flow of your code

# Description
Ever wonder how stackprof can profile your code? Or maybe how you could create your own code coverage system? In this
talk you'll learn about Tracepoint, a standard library that can trace the execution of your Ruby code. We'll introduce
the facilities of the library, and then work through an example of how we can use Tracepoint to build a call graph of
your code.
