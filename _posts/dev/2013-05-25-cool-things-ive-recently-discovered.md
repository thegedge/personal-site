As always, it's taken me a while to write a new post. I guess I don't have a lot to talk about?
Anyways, over the past month I've come across some cool little projects that I thought I'd share
with y'all.

1. [knockout.js](https://knockoutjs.com/) is a simple and lightweight (14kb minified JS) framework
   for developing single-page web apps with declarative bindings. We're talking about the bare
   necessities here: binding attributes to DOM elements and having them automatically refresh.
   There's a few other things you can do with it, but those are the big ones I was looking for.
2. [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) is a neat project that can take LLVM bytecode and convert it
   into Javascript. The reason this is cool is because as long as you can compile a project and its
   dependcies to LLVM bytecode, you can run it on the web. Definitely visit the website and check
   out the demos. Some examples of projects that have been ported to the web with emscripten:
   - Various Qt demos (GUI framework)
   - LaTeX and BibTeX (typesetting)
   - gnuplot (scientific graphing application)
   - Dune II (video game)
   - Box2D and Bullet (physics engines)
   - Other scripting languages such as Python, Ruby, and Lua
   - Many more!
3. [Web Components](https://www.w3.org/TR/components-intro/) are potentially the future of web. The
   focus is on developing reusable components/widgets for your web apps. It's probably best for you
   to check out the [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqULJBBEVQE) instead of having
   me try to summarize things poorly.
