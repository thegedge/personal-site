So what's this score editing application I've been talking about in my posts? We've decided to give a pre-beta teaser. Minus a couple of rendering issues, here's what she looked like a couple of days ago (click image for larger preview):

For our first release we focused on guitar tabs, and making sure the application as a whole works together properly. Unfortunately this release will be a private beta, so everyone will have to wait. I think we have a pretty good app for ~4 months of work (sparse work too, since we're both busy with school and work). Hopefully I've tweaked your interest!
