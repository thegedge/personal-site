description: I added physics to my game engine, with the Bullet library.

I haven't done a whole lot with my game engine stuff over the past week (been focusing on
implementing GPU splatting for my research), but I decided to capture a video today. It's a little
low quality, but it shows off the basics. For the most part, there's enough functionality in there
to start working on a game, but I want to make the code simpler and easier to work with. Anyways,
here's the video:

Currently I'm using Bullet for Physics, CEGUI for the in-game GUI, DevIL for loading images, OpenGL
for rendering and a whole lot of boost to make my life easier. The windowing (Cocoa, Carbon, X11 or
Win32) is my own. Eventually I might do the same for the image loading and in-game GUI so that there
are less dependencies, but for now I don't really care too much about that. I'm planning out a
simple game to make eventually, so look forward to that in the future. Perhaps not the very near
future, but quite possibly by the end of the year.
