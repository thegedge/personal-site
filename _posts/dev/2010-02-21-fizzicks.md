I haven't done a whole lot with my game engine stuff over the past week (been
focusing on implementing GPU splatting for my research), but I decided to
capture a video today. It's a little low quality, but it shows off the basics.
For the most part, there's enough functionality in there to start working on a
game, but I want to make the code simpler and easier to work with. Anyways,
here's the video:

<div id="fb-root"></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = "https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>

<div style="width: 450px; height: 340px; margin: auto;">
<div class="fb-video" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/gedge/videos/vb.631265294/353403840294/?type=2&video_source=user_video_tab" data-width="500" data-show-text="false"></div>
</div>

Currently I'm using Bullet for Physics, CEGUI for the in-game GUI, DevIL for
loading images, OpenGL for rendering and a whole lot of boost to make my life
easier. The windowing (Cocoa, Carbon, X11 or Win32) is my own. Eventually I
might do the same for the image loading and in-game GUI so that there are less
dependencies, but for now I don't really care too much about that. I'm planning
out a simple game to make eventually, so look forward to that in the future.
Perhaps not the very near future, but quite possibly by the end of the year.
