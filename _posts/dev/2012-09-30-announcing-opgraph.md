This is an announcement of a new project I'm proud to release: __OpGraph__.
Check out my portfolio for a summary, or visit the [project page](http://thegedge.github.com/opgraph).

The OpGraph project is all about providing a foundation for creating complex
operations from simple ones. One creates a set of simple operations which can
then be linked together to create a more complex operation.

This was a project that I created initially for the [Phon](http://phon.ling.mun.ca)
project earlier in the year. I realized that this work could easily be made
general-purpose, hence the birth of OpGraph. My hope is that this project will
be of use to others.
