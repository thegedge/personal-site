This is an announcement of a new project I'm proud to release: **OpGraph**. Check out my portfolio
for a summary, or visit the [project page](https://thegedge.github.com/opgraph).

The OpGraph project is all about providing a foundation for creating complex operations from simple
ones. One creates a set of simple operations which can then be linked together to create a more
complex operation.

This was a project that I created initially for the [Phon](https://www.phon.ca/) project earlier in
the year. I realized that this work could easily be made general-purpose, hence the birth of
OpGraph. My hope is that this project will be of use to others.
