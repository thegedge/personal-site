description: Using QGraphicsView really stepped up our rendering game in the score editor project.

Well, the score editor project my friend and I have been working on has taken a bit of a regression.
In particular, we decided to switch to Qt and C++ because Swing just wasn't doing it for us. It just
lacked in a native feel, particularly on the Mac.

So there's nothing much new here, but by using `QGraphicsView` we have been able to really do some
neat stuff. In particular, printing was a breeze but also exporting PDFs and supporting zoom. We
also decided to display the score in pages instead of one long, unified page. I think it gives it a
more professional feel, and also shows you exactly how it will look when printed. Anyways, a screen
shot showing the zooming out, and also a new splash screen that yours truly put together. Not too
shabby, but it still needs a bit more pizazz.
