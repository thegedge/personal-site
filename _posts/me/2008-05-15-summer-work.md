Well my research job started last week and I'm looking forward to some results, although they won't
come till later on this summer. I will be researching two areas:

1. [Image stitching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panorama_stitching)
2. [Feature matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_detection_%28computer_vision%29)

The basic idea is to take a set of photos and generate multiple panoramas from them appropriately.
After this I will be estimating camera poses and with some form of a transform allow the user to
travel from one panorama to the next. This should end up being a fully automated process so that one
can easily create "virtual tours". It is sort of a combination of different software (such as
[Microsoft PhotoSynth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynth) and
[Quicktime VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime_VR).

I'm hoping by the end of the summer I'll have most of the concepts straightened out and some
tools/software created to generate these tours and display them. Depending on the results I may
carry on with this project for my honours thesis. Such a thesis would be an extension on this work
and would probably include improved algorithms along with efficiency improvements, such as utilizing
the GPU for tour generation.

Whenever I start getting results, I'll make another post. Once I understand the domain better I'll
probably even post some technical information (for those of us who enjoy learning)!
