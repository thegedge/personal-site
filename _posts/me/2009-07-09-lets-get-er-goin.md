So it has been awhile since my last post, but I've been keeping myself busy with research and a
large personal project that a friend and I are working on. It's a musical score editor written in
Java. I'm keeping this post short but I think I will start blogging about that project, the issues
we face, and the decisions we make to resolve these issues. I'll also talk about various design
decisions we make, and maybe even some other stuff too, like our rendering system. Hopefully my
future posts will provide useful insight and information on various topics surrounding development
in Java.
