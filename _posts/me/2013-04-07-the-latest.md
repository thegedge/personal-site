It's been awhile since my last update, so I thought I'd mention what's been happening lately:

- Since the end of February, I've been working for Google. More specifically, I'm working at
  YouTube.
- In my spare time I've been playing around with a ray tracer project. In particular, I was looking
  to accomplish two things with this:
  1.  to learn even more about global illumination and optimization, and
  2.  to create a ray tracer project in which the scene description language was Python.

That's really all that's up. I'll try to post a little more on the ray tracer project. Right now
it's still just lying around on my computer, but hopefully I'll have it pushed to my GitHub soon.
